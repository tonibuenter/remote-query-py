conda install -c anaconda mysql-connector-python


preview-generator

https://pypi.org/project/preview-generator/


pip install preview-generator


Note about requirements: some packages are needed for installing python. If the pip install preview-generator command fails, try to install zlib and libjpeg dev packages. On debian-based OSes this can be done through the following command:

apt-get install zlib1g-dev libjpeg-dev
